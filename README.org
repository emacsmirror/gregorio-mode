* What is gregorio-mode.el ?
  This is a major mode derived from the tex-mode in order to edit
  .gabc files for use with Gregorio. Gregorio is Free Software that is
  used to typeset Gregorian chant. You can find more about gregorio
  at its [[http://home.gna.org/gregorio/][home page]].
* Installation
** Using GIT
   If you are on this page, you probably know how to use git. To
   install this major mode, just do the following:

*** 1. from the terminal, move into the ~/.emacs.d directory:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cd ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC
*** 2. Then clone this repository into that directory   
   #+BEGIN_SRC git
   git clone https://github.com/cajetanus/gregorio-mode.el.git
   #+END_SRC
*** 3. Finally, add the following line to your .emacs file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (load "~/.emacs.d/gregorio-mode.el/gregorio-mode")
   #+END_SRC
   You can then do C-x C-e at the end of this line, or simply restart
   Emacs. The major mode will activate when you visit an .gabc file.
** Using el-get
   Eventually this major mode will be available through the [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get
   package system]]. This page will be updated when the pull request
   has been processed.
