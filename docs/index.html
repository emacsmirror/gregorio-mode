<h2>How to use gregorio-mode</h2>
<p>Once you have installed gregorio-mode.el as in the instructions, gregorio mode will become active upon loading a .gabc file. If you wish to immediately start writing a new file, simply open a new buffer and then type: <pre>M-x gregorio-mode</pre>.</p>
<p>You will notice immediately that there is now simple syntax coloring for the gregorio file. These can be customized by modifying the values in the gregorio-mode.el file. Note that the notes are a separate color from the text, and that the text itself is bold so that it is easier to discern and find eventual errors.</p>

<p>For the syntax of gabc you should study the <a href="http://home.gna.org/gregorio/tutorial/tutorial-gabc-01">tutorial</a> available on the <a href="http://home.gna.org/gregorio/">gregorio site</a>.</p>
<p>When you have completed your .gabc file, the gregorio-mode has some simple functions that can be useful. The most important of these is the making of the .tex file. In order to compile your .gabc source into tex, simply press F1 [Function Key 1]. You will then see another buffer form in another window which contains the TeX source generated from the .gabc file. </p>

<p>You will notice that the new buffer is already in tex-mode for syntax highlighting, but it hasn't been saved yet. This allows you to quickly inspect the code and you can modify it as well. To save with the default name which is simply the same name as the .gabc file with a different extension (.tex instead of .gabc), simply do C-x C-s. If you already have a file with that name you will be asked if you want to overwrite it.</p>
<p>Note that this .tex source cannot be typeset by itself. The usual way of typsetting gregorio is to insert the source in another LaTeX document which is the template. You can see an example of this template on the gregorio website, or in the examples folder of gregorio-mode.el.</p>

<p>In this template (main.tex in our case) you include the source which you have just created from the .gabc file by the TeX command: <pre>\include{file_name.tex}</pre>, where 'file_name.tex' is the name of the file you saved after creating the source.</p>
<p>While in the template file, if your emacs is already set up for using luatex as the tex engine, you can just press C-c C-c and you will be able to view the new .pdf with your score. </p>
